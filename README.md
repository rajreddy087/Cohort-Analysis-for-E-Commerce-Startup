Cohort Analysis By Using Excel
## Overview
This project focuses on conducting a cohort analysis to understand customer behavior, retention, and sales performance over time for an e-commerce startup. The analysis is based on cohort data segmented by the month customers made their first purchase.

## Tables Analyzed
The following tables were used to derive insights:
1. **Cohort Percentage of Total Customers**: Displays the percentage of customers remaining in each cohort month-over-month.
2. **Cohort Customer Retention**: Shows the number of customers retained each month for each cohort.
3. **Sales Contribution by Cohort**: Shows the sales contribution for each cohort across months.
4. **Average Sale Value by Cohort**: Displays the average sale value for each cohort month-over-month.

## Key Insights
1. **Retention Trends**:
   - Higher retention in early months for newer cohorts.
   - A general decline in retention after 6-12 months of customer acquisition.
   
2. **Customer Behavior**:
   - Customers tend to contribute more in terms of revenue during the first few months after purchase, with a declining trend over time.
   - Seasonal fluctuations in retention and revenue suggest the influence of promotions or product cycles.

3. **Revenue Contribution**:
   - Newer cohorts show high early sales but tend to drop off after 3-6 months.
   - Long-term customers may contribute consistently, but their average sale value tends to decrease over time.

## Data Used
- Customer cohort data spanning multiple months.
- Sales data reflecting individual customer purchases across the cohorts.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for cohort analysis and data visualization.
- Pivot tables to analyze customer retention, sales contribution, and average sale value.

## Conclusion
This cohort analysis helps identify key patterns in customer retention and sales behavior, providing insights for customer acquisition strategies, retention improvement, and targeted marketing efforts. The trends observed can guide future business decisions aimed at increasing customer lifetime value and optimizing revenue generation.
